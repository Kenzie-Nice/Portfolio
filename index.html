            Identified and documented gameplay logic issues, including soft lock scenarios caused by NPC interactions (e.g., Inspector boarding events locking doors and blocking player progression).

Reported collision and movement bugs, such as multiple NPCs overlapping and becoming stuck, requiring manual intervention to resolve.

Provided feedback on confusing gameplay elements, focusing on unclear player expectations during time-sensitive events (e.g., limited response window when the Inspector boards).

Suggested UI/UX improvements for tutorial clarity, emphasizing simplified control instructions for accessibility to a wider audience.

Delivered actionable recommendations to improve player experience, reduce frustration points, and enhance overall game flow.
